Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.21,0:00:12.30,Default,,0,0,0,,It's been an eventful journey for Polestar so far and not without obstacles,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.30,0:00:17.58,Default,,0,0,0,,but through determination, innovation and an obsession with detail,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.58,0:00:20.67,Default,,0,0,0,,We finally arrived at a very exciting stage.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.87,0:00:25.23,Default,,0,0,0,,VP, verification prototype build.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.97,0:00:30.66,Default,,0,0,0,,It's one thing to design a car that challenges existing norms,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.66,0:00:34.29,Default,,0,0,0,,while also raising the bar for electric cars the world over.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.28,0:00:40.11,Default,,0,0,0,,It's another thing entirely to realize that design in real life.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.22,0:00:43.86,Default,,0,0,0,,From aesthetics to driver experience,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.86,0:00:46.77,Default,,0,0,0,,no stone is left unturned during these builds.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.36,0:00:56.10,Default,,0,0,0,,The VP cars are the first build series and a major player in these prototype builds is carbon fiber.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.63,0:01:04.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Carbon fiber figures hugely in the Polestar1.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.12,0:01:08.76,Default,,0,0,0,,ten times stronger and five times lighter than steel.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.76,0:01:14.24,Default,,0,0,0,,Carbon fiber is the ideal material to realize the ambitious plans for this car
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.24,0:01:19.44,Default,,0,0,0,,to make the body more rigid and therefore create more responsive handling.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.44,0:01:25.50,Default,,0,0,0,,The entire upper body of the Polestar1 is carbon fiber reinforced polymer.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.50,0:01:27.03,Default,,0,0,0,,but that's not all.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.03,0:01:31.59,Default,,0,0,0,,the true carbon fiber game changer is the dragonfly.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.59,0:01:39.21,Default,,0,0,0,,A CFRP patch bonded to the steel underbody to increase torsional stiffness by 45%.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.21,0:01:42.18,Default,,0,0,0,,The dragonfly, actually three parts,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.18,0:01:52.86,Default,,0,0,0,,the body and the wings glued into place and fired in the oven at 85 degrees for 45 minutes also strengthens this traditionally weak point.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.73,0:01:56.67,Default,,0,0,0,,The next stop is the hang on parts area,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.67,0:02:01.83,Default,,0,0,0,,where components are measured with unforgiving precision before they're attached.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.83,0:02:06.66,Default,,0,0,0,,The slightest of misalignments can cause a disruption of the feature lines,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.66,0:02:10.50,Default,,0,0,0,,thus compromising the Polestar1's distinctive design.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.34,0:02:19.02,Default,,0,0,0,,Working with carbon fiber, however, can present different challenges.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.18,0:02:21.75,Default,,0,0,0,,painting, for example,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.75,0:02:26.70,Default,,0,0,0,,carbon fiber substrates aren't smooth and free of imperfections like steel,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.70,0:02:28.35,Default,,0,0,0,,and they have a distinctive weave.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.31,0:02:30.78,Default,,0,0,0,,The solution,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.78,0:02:37.03,Default,,0,0,0,,a combination of machine sanding and hand sanding to give the panels a smooth, even finish
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.54,0:02:46.65,Default,,0,0,0,,fine sanding is done by hand to ensure the integrity of the feature lines and to stay true to the initial design.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.65,0:02:50.79,Default,,0,0,0,,The marriage point is the true test of all this exacting measurement.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.72,0:02:54.09,Default,,0,0,0,,Where the chassis is attached to the body.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.23,0:02:59.70,Default,,0,0,0,,The parts are attached by a series of bolts protruding from the chassis,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.70,0:03:01.71,Default,,0,0,0,,which then slide into the upper body.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.76,0:03:05.97,Default,,0,0,0,,If even one of the bolts is misaligned
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.97,0:03:08.25,Default,,0,0,0,,the process must begin again.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.74,0:03:14.97,Default,,0,0,0,,With every Union performed, the process goes more smoothly.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.97,0:03:19.66,Default,,0,0,0,,This means fewer adjustments and a shorter construction time
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.66,0:03:23.37,Default,,0,0,0,,closer and closer to perfection with each marriage.
