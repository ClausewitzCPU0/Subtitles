00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,460
大家好！我是你们的好兄弟 Jonathan Burton
Hey guys it's me it's your best friend

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:04,656
来自Carbon Animations
it's Jonathan Burton Carbon animations

3
00:00:04,656 --> 00:00:07,950
我收到了很多观众对于动画教学的问题
and I get a lot of questions about tutorial videos

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,400
今天我将教你们用最简单的办法做动画
and today I'm gonna give you the simplest way to animate

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,800
可能这么说并不准确，但这确实是一种很好的练习
well it's not really, but it's a good exercise,

6
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:16,224
有助于你理解动画制作
and it helps you understand animation

7
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,060
所谓动画
if you know what animation is,

8
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:19,710
它研究运动
it is the study of motion.

9
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:22,830
它是生命的幻象(The illusion of life也是一本动画教程书籍的名字)
It is the illusion of life,

10
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:26,400
有些逐帧作画的感觉
and it is framed by frame work kinda.

11
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,440
但也不是所有的动画都需要逐帧来画
I mean, it doesn't always have to be frame by frame.

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,960
今天我们将要学习绘画运动效果
But today we're going to study the motion

13
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:40,830
这将有助于理解动画制作过程，以及物体如何在画布空间中移动
and it's gonna help to understand how to animate and how things move in the space on the canvas.

14
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:42,660
我认为这很有用
I think it's really helpful.

15
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:45,150
这就是"点动画"
It's called Dot animation.

16
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:49,290
科班学习的第一课通常会让你画一个球
So in school, usually they make you animate a ball as the first thing.

17
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,430
但我们只画一个点
but we're going to do a dot.

18
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:56,370
画点更简单，因为一个球体有外形样式，而点就很简单
It's even simpler because a ball it has it's got form *or a dot is just a dot.

19
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:01,920
接下来要画出一个点以及我们想让它执行的动作
so we're going to animate a dot and a motion that we want.

20
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:08,880
目标是让一个角色助跑并跳过已经画好的小沟
And so we want a character to run and jump across this this little pit here that I've already drawn,

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,060
想要让角色动作看起来更完美
and so that character we want the motion to look good *though,

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,170
可以先用画点的方式来练习
so we're going to practice with a dot,

23
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:18,750
这个点就代表着人物
as if the dot is running and jumping,

24
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:20,790
在这里先画个点
so the dot is going to be over here,

25
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:25,740
点的位置大概就是人物胸部的位置
and it's gonna represent the kind of the, I guess the chest of the character.

26
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:33,630
这样点就画好了 我要把笔的压感关了
OK, so there's the dots, actually I'm going to remove my pressure sensitivity,

27
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:35,700
这样点的大小就不会变
so the dot doesn't change really,

28
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:42,000
我们要让这个点跳过小沟
there's the dots and we're going to make the dot run and jump across this,

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,160
这个过程就是角色奔跑跳跃的样板
and that's going to give us our template for our motion of a character running and jumping.

30
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,530
打开绘图纸外观模式(Alt+Shift+O),按F7创建新的帧
Alright we're gonna have onion skin turned on press F7 to form new frame.

31
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:57,090
绘图纸模式可以同时显示先前帧和之后的帧
and because the onion skin, we're going to see our previous frame and the next frame.

32
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:57,900
目前我们还没画下一帧
We have no next frame,

33
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:59,880
但我们现在已经可以看到前一帧了
but we're gonna see our previous frame here,

34
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:05,160
小点会缓慢提速
and so the dot is gonna start to slowly build up some speed,

35
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,240
我还会让它略微弹跳一下
and I'm even going to bounce it up and down a bit

36
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,960
因为人的奔跑动作就是这样的
Because that's how people run.

37
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:25,650
弹跳的幅度不需要太大
I'm going to bounce up and down just a little bit.

38
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,090
继续画
More.

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,400
小点逐步地运动到另一边
And we're going to start to gradually drag this across.

40
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:45,180
点之间的间距会越来越远
Gradually move further and further apart with the dots,

41
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:49,740
因为它运动得越来越快
because that means the character is getting faster and faster,

42
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:54,630
确保每次画点的时候略微增加间距
so we gotta make sure we're moving a little bit further apart each time we do a dots.

43
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:02,100
这里角色略微停顿准备跳跃
and the character is going to kind of *windup for a jump off it,

44
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:04,410
就要画得离地面近一些
so I'm going to make them stay closer to the ground.

45
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,710
画出一点点减速的效果
And even even kind of.

46
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,830
因为角色要做起跳前的准备动作
Slow down a little bit because you wind up for that jump.

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,230
接下去就是跳跃动作
So he's going to jump.

48
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,490
第一帧要远一些
the first frame is going to be a little bit further.

49
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,880
之后角色离地
And then, as you jump in the air,

50
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:28,740
在横向和纵向都会减速
you start to slow down both in height and in distance.

51
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,540
因为速度变慢
because the speed is starting to wear off.

52
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,000
现在它已经跳过了小沟
it looks like he's going to completely clear this gap here.

53
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,010
接下来就是落地
And again, the landing.

54
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:49,020
因为落地需要一些调整的时间
because he's landing is going to be a bit of recovery time.

55
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,310
搞定了
that's it OK?

56
00:03:56,311 --> 00:03:57,240
奔跑跳跃
So run jump.

57
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,770
是不是有内味了？
It looks like it, okay?

58
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,080
有点像了
Looks like it.

59
00:04:04,081 --> 00:04:05,220
你也可以简化一下
You can make it simpler,

60
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:11,190
你也可以省略弹跳的过程，其他照做就行
you don't have to add the bouncing in just if you don't have the bouncing and you just do the exact same thing,

61
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:18,660
只要确保每次的间距增加就行
you just make sure you're doing it a little bit further apart each time.

62
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:21,270
再画一次没有弹跳的过程
So again, this is it. Without a bouncing.

63
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,740
增加一点点间距
And you just do it a little bit further apart.

64
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,120
直到你觉得到达最大速度时
Until you feel like, okay, that's Max speed okay yeah,

65
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:31,860
这就是最大速度下的间距
it's going to be that far apart is Max speed.

66
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,070
接下来还是同样的步骤，画跳跃动作
And you do the exact same thing and then you can do the jump.

67
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,610
同样的方法
that's again similar.

68
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:53,700
正视错误，及时改正
And don't be afraid to cancel it. Dots deleted.

69
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,120
这样就画好了
there you go And this will be.

70
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,980
你可以做出同样的效果
So you can do the exact same thing.

71
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:09,660
这就是跳过小沟的一个很好的动作示例
so that is too... very, very fine motions of running and jumping over a pit,

72
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:14,790
现在你就可以照着我的原版来试着做了
and now you can follow the dots when you want to only use my original one,

73
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,140
按点的轨迹来画
you can follow that dots.

74
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,230
接下来我将帮助你做出完整的动画
*And I'll help(hope?) you to actually do it.

75
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,040
再看一个更短更简单的例子
Let's see the other one because it's shorter and also its simpler

76
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,650
我们希望例子尽可能简单
and we want to keep things as simple as possible.

77
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,130
因此我把点变成了小红圈
So I made the dot into a red the little circle.

78
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,930
只需要按一下这个按键(将所有图层显示为轮廓)
By hitting this color code button.

79
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,135
接下来要把它变成枪兵
And then we'll make it into a marine

80
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:40,380
枪兵是星际2中画的最快的单位了
marine is the quickest thing to draw in Starcraft.

81
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:47,400
和之前一样，只画一个角色
So again. We'll just uses a character,

82
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,340
然后就是相同的运动轨迹
and then he starts to run and again we can use the exact same motion.

83
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,550
跑步循环则有些不同
and run cycles are a little bit different,

84
00:05:56,551 --> 00:06:00,360
跑步循环有个另外的教程
There is a lesson on their own.

85
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:01,680
今天我们不涉及跑步循环的教程
And we're not going to be run cycle today,

86
00:06:01,681 --> 00:06:05,100
只是展示这个运动轨迹可以用作参考
but just to show that you can use that motion as a guide.

87
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,880
运动轨迹非常有用
And that it does work

88
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:16,950
当需要事先测试运动效果时，这是一种不错的方式。
and it's a good little template you can give yourself, you want to test out the motion first and that it's a decent way to do it.

89
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,710
它跑得越来越快
He's now getting faster,

90
00:06:22,711 --> 00:06:26,580
红圈要在头的中间位置
and again it's going to be like in the middle of his head here.

91
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,570
我不会花太多时间在角色细节上
And I'm not going to spend too much time on the actual character.

92
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,440
你可以用符号来表示奔跑动画
You can use a symbol for run animation.

93
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,370
其实我应该提前准备一个跑步动画，这样效果会好得多
Actually I should have probably prepared one that would have been a lot nicer.

94
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,310
你明白我的意思
Yes, you get the idea.

95
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,680
如果你有已经做好的跑步动画
If you have a run animation already set,

96
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:09,750
只需要让它跟着运动点就可以了
Then you just make it follow the dots and you're good to go.

97
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,730
如果没有的话，也可以用符号代替
But if not, you could make a run animation symbol.

98
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,000
还是让符号跟随运动点
And then make it follow the dot as well.

99
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,470
现在枪兵要准备跳过去
Now he's going to start to wind up for his jump,

100
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:34,470
所以需要下蹲一些
so he's going to go a little lower. Lower again,

101
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,940
我有时候会很敷衍地做这部分动画
Sometimes I do this kind of animation episode where it's just very, very sloppy

102
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:47,130
还挺管用，因为我们每周都有一堆工作要做
and you know it works because we have bunch of cartoons *to do every week,

103
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:53,370
当工作量远超你的能力时，就可以用这种办法来应付更多事情
*but also it's far away if things are far away than you can, you can get away with a lot more things.

104
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:56,096
效果还可以
*It doesn't look as nearly as bad

105
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:57,630
接着画下去
here we are to do.

106
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,060
跳起来
Jumping.

107
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,390
照着模板做就行
Again, just following your template.

108
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,890
画出空中动作
Into the air.

109
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,560
画出四肢
His limbs,

110
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:22,920
四肢要略微落后于整体的运动方向
*always dragging behind a bits of what he's doing.

111
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,770
压扁一些
Squish that down.

112
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,230
注意身体的朝向，因为身体的指向就是运动的方向
*where his bodies going because his body is leading the way.

113
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:39,300
必须保证红点在角色头部位置
Got to make sure the red dot is where his ahead is.

114
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,300
落地
and he lands.

115
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:58,800
像这样低头
His head down like this.

116
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,620
再低一些
It goes down a little bit more.

117
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,370
四肢也朝下
And now his limbs come down too,

118
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:10,470
开始调整动作
and I started to recover

119
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:13,680
缩小帧的范围，因为不需要用到之前的帧做参考了
and take away some onion skin frames because I don't need them

120
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:14,850
开始站起来
he starts to recover a bit.

121
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,430
四肢朝下，同时抬头
And his limbs are down and he looks up.

122
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,540
这部分内容
In this part, I mean I don't like, I mean,

123
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:34,950
如果你是个新手，我不要求你把这部分全画出来
if you're new at animation I don't expect you just animate completely this part here.

124
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:42,210
你需要做的是画出角色的某一部分，比如主体部分
What you want to do is animates one one piece of the character like the body, the main body,

125
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:43,470
之后才增加细节
and then the details after.

126
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:44,670
就是这种效果
*But this is how it looks.

127
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,940
它始终跟随着这些点移动
And it follows the exact same animations as the dots.

128
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:49,950
这就是简单的练习过程
so that's a simple exercise.

129
00:09:49,951 --> 00:10:01,350
如果你需要掌握如何在动画软件中画出运动效果
If you just need to to get used to how movement works in an animation program,

130
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:06,480
不要先画枪兵或是具体角色，而是先画点
don't do the Marine first,the character ,do the dot.

131
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:13,590
点动画能帮助你理解角色如何运动
The dot will help you understand how the motion works,

132
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:16,350
如何恰当地加速和减速
how to slow things down and speed things up properly,

133
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:17,760
我认为这是个很好的练习
and I think it's a good exercise,

134
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:23,130
这就是做动画最快的办法，也是个很好的小练习
so it is the quickest way to animates and a nice little exercise,

135
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:25,140
正如我所展示的
and it can be as I showed you,

136
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:30,420
一个适用于所有人物运动的教程
a guide for your motion for a character whatever it is,

137
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,010
好了 你现在已经学会了
OK, you figure it out.

138
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:33,450
点动画确实有用
But yeah, dots can help.

139
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:34,920
这就是全部内容了
So that's it guys.

140
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:38,130
为你们做的一个动画小教程
a little quick little animation tutorial for you.

141
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:43,740
展示了点动画和这个小练习
how dot animation or a quick little animation exercise can help you out.
