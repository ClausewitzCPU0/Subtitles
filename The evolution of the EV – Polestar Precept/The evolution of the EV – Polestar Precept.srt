1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:08,000
It is about time I gave an answer to a question I have been asked a hundred times.
是时候回答一个被提及多次的问题了：

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,799
Where is the brand Polestar heading?
Polestar品牌将何去何从

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,800
We brought the Polestar 1 into production and we launched the Polestar 2.
我们将Polestar1投入量产，并发布了Polestar2

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,000
Now for us inside Polestar we have a clear vision of where we are going.
现在，我们对Polestar的前景有了清晰的认知

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,199
The answer is the Polestar Precept.
答案就是Polestar Precept(概念车)

6
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:42,759
Precept is an incarnation of the philosophy of our design, of our idea about how sustainability
Precept是我们设计哲学的化身

7
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:49,559
can become a driving force, a driving  energy for our new cars.
代表我们使用可持续能源作为汽车动力的理念

8
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,679
That is what Precept is all about.
这就是Precept概念车的意义

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:06,319
A big focus, a strong focus is obviously an interior, that reduces the amount of plastic that you use.
内饰显然是理念的重点之一，着眼于减少塑料的使用。

10
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,599
We work together with specialised partners and experts to cut the plastic content and
我们与专业公司和专家协作，在概念车的内饰中降低塑料的用量

11
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:19,599
lessen waste materials with innovative natural and recycled source materials, in the interior of the Polestar Precept.
通过创新的自然材料以及可回收材料来减少物料的浪费

12
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,039
With the amazing powerRibs and ampliTex technologies from our partner Bcomp,
得益于合作伙伴Bcomp公司的powerRibs(天然纤维增强)和ampliTex(天然纤维织物)技术

13
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:30,500
we turn natural fibers into lightweight and sustainable interior panels.
我们将天然纤维加入到轻量化且可回收的内饰板中

14
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,465
This natural composite utilises flax
这是一种亚麻天然合成材料

15
00:01:33,465 --> 00:01:46,000
and these new innovative interior panels then are up to 50% lighter and they reduce the plastic content by 80% compared to the traditional ones.
这些创新的内饰板相较传统材料，最多可以减重50%，且减少了80%的塑料使用量

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,599
It’s really amazing, it’s lighter and at the same time stronger.
这种卓越的材料在减重的同时还能保持相同的强度

17
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,853
Now on the seats we introduce 3D Knit material,
座椅则使用了3D Knit材料

18
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:58,000
like what is used in the fashion or footwear industries.
这种材料也被用于时装和制鞋工业

19
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,119
It’s made out of 100% recycled yarn derived from PET, pet bottles.
完全使用可回收的涤纶丝制成，和宝特瓶的材料一样。

20
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,120
It’s made exactly to size with no offcuts
它可以制成各种想要的形状，避免产生边角料

21
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,400
and that means we’ve completely removed the waste in its production process.
这意味着我们可以完全消除生产过程中的原材料浪费

22
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:21,039
So, to show that car interior can be the nice atmosphere that you want it to be,
创造称心如意的内饰氛围

23
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,159
without the usual use of an excessive amount of virgin plastic,
而不像过去那样过度使用纯塑料材质，

24
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,639
I think that is one of the main focus areas of Precept.
我认为这就是Precept的一个主要理念

25
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,120
When we presented last year the Polestar 2
去年发布Polestar2时，

26
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:43,280
we were the first car brand coming out with a production car that has Android.
我们是第一个在量产车上使用安卓系统的品牌

27
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,117
Now that has incredible potential for the future, 
它的未来不可限量

28
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:51,800
and some of it gives a glimpse of how great the system will evolve over time.
其中一些特性让我们窥见这套系统将来的演进方向

29
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,320
We take here in the Polestar Precept,
我们也把这套系统带到了Precept上

30
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:02,840
example given, one that I actually like the most, is the proximity sensor that we built in there.
举例来说，我最喜欢的一个特性，就是内置的距离传感器

31
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:09,439
You see an uncluttered, very easy to read aesthetically nice screen.
车内有简洁优雅的屏幕

32
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,080
But then when you reach out, buttons pop out, and more information comes.
当你伸出手时，按钮会弹出，同时屏幕显示更多内容

33
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,840
Big buttons that are easy to touch even when the car is moving.
大尺寸的按钮在行驶时更易操作

34
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:28,759
So this animated proximity sensor is really a big big step into this hassle-free future that we promise with our cars.
基于距离传感器的动画效果正是我们所承诺的简化操作的重要一环

35
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:35,000
A big leap for safety in the car is the eye tracking system of the Precept.
车辆安全性的飞跃则来自Precept的眼球追踪系统

36
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,240
One of the core benefits is monitoring the driver's health status.
系统的一个核心功能就是监测驾驶者的健康状况

37
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,439
Is he tired, is she watching the road?
他是否疲劳？她是否在看路面？

38
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:48,799
If not, the car takes appropriate actions such as warning or speed reduction.
如果有异常，车辆会做出合适的反馈，例如警示或减速

39
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,519
On the driver-dedicated monitor in front of you,
驾驶员前方的显示器

40
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:59,920
the information and signals of the pilot assist system are now combined with Google maps data.
展示的信息和驾驶辅助系统指示，现已与谷歌地图数据结合到了一起

41
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:07,439
So the turn-by-turn guidance is embedded into a fully contextualised navigation.
因此细致的导航指示得以嵌入到导航系统中

42
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,200
Where black holes for air intakes and cooling define the era of combustion engines,
传统燃油时代车型的前脸中冷进气格栅位置，

43
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:20,480
the face of the Polestar is characterised and defined by the SmartZone
在Polestar上被替换成了独特的SmartZone

44
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:27,560
where technology for safety sensors and pilot assistance is purposefully gathered.
安全传感器和驾驶辅助系统就集成在此。

45
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,480
Instead of tradition and preindustrial craftsmanship, we defined the new premium,
区别于传统的手工技艺，我们定义了一种新的高级感

46
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,480
a premium that left the convention of  leather, wood and chrome behind.
一种抛弃传统的皮革、木材、镀铬所营造的高级感

47
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,600
This will be the aesthetics of the electric age, high-tech minimalism that redefines
这将成为电动时代的美学，一种高科技的简约风格，

48
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,400
luxury for the sustainable decade.
可以重新定义下一个十年的豪华风格

49
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,000
*We have pressing questions that need answers.
我们已经提出了那些迫在眉睫的问题

50
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,439
Clearly sustainability is not limited to the electric drivetrain.
显然，可持续概念不仅仅局限于电力驱动系统

51
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:14,280
Sustainability means on a much broader sense, from the very first step of the production of the car,
可持续概念有着更加广泛的意义

52
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:26,399
to the very end when you actually take care of what is left of the car in the recycling process, to come to a fully sustainable chain of mobility.
从回收处理报废车辆的材料，到移动出行全环节的可持续链条

53
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,195
It’s a new era that has started
未来已至

54
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:33,709
and the Polestar Precept is a messenger of what is to come,
Polestar Precept就是新纪元的信使

55
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:37,319
and a reminder that our journey has just begun.
预示着全新的旅程才刚刚开始
