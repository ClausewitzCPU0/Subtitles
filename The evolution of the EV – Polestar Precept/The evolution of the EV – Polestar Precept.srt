1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:08,000
It is about time I gave an answer to a question I have been asked a hundred times.

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,799
Where is the brand Polestar heading?

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,800
We brought the Polestar 1 into production and we launched the Polestar 2.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,000
Now for us inside Polestar we have a clear vision of where we are going.

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,199
The answer is the Polestar Precept.

6
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:42,759
Precept is an incarnation of the philosophy of our design, of our idea about how sustainability 

7
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:49,559
can become a driving force, a driving  energy for our new cars. 

8
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,679
That is what Precept is all about.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,279
A big focus, a strong focus is obviously an interior, that reduces the amount of

10
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,319
plastic that you use.

11
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,599
We work together with specialised partners and experts to cut the plastic content and

12
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:17,000
lessen waste materials with innovative natural and recycled source materials, 

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,599
in the interior of the Polestar Precept. 

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,039
With the amazing powerRibs and ampliTex technologies from our partner Bcomp, 

15
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:30,500
we turn natural fibers into lightweight and sustainable interior panels.

16
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:36,719
This natural composite utilises flax and these new innovative interior panels then

17
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:46,000
are up to 50% lighter and they reduce the plastic content by 80% compared to the traditional ones. 

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,599
It’s really amazing, it’s lighter and at the same time stronger.

19
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,159
Now on the seats we introduce 3D Knit material, like what is used in the fashion

20
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,000
or footwear industries.

21
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,119
It’s made out of 100% recycled yarn derived from PET, pet bottles. 

22
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:11,560
It’s made exactly to size with no offcuts and that means we’ve completely removed

23
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,400
the waste in its production process. 

24
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:21,039
So, to show that car interior can be the nice atmosphere that you want it to be, 

25
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,159
without the usual use of an excessive amount of virgin plastic, 

26
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,639
I think that is one of the main focus areas of Precept.

27
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:39,799
When we presented last year the Polestar 2 we were the first car brand coming out

28
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,280
with a production car that has Android.

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,840
Now that has incredible potential for the future, and some of it a gives

30
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,800
a glimpse of how great the system will evolve over time.

31
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,680
We take here in the Polestar Precept, example given, one that I actually like the most,

32
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,840
is the proximity sensor that we built in there.

33
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:09,439
You see an uncluttered, very easy to read aesthetically nice screen.

34
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,080
But then when you reach out, buttons pop out, and more information comes.

35
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,840
Big buttons that are easy to touch even when the car is moving. 

36
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:26,280
So this animated proximity sensor is really a big big step into this hassle-free 

37
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,759
future that we promise with our cars. 

38
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:35,000
A big leap for safety in the car is the eye tracking system of the Precept. 

39
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,240
One of the core benefits is monitoring the driver's health status. 

40
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,439
Is he tired, is she watching the road?

41
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:48,799
If not, the car takes appropriate actions such as warning or speed reduction. 

42
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,560
On the driver-dedicated monitor in front of you, the information 

43
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,920
and signals of the pilot assist system are now combined with Google maps data. 

44
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:07,439
So the turn-by-turn guidance is embedded into a fully contextualised navigation.

45
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,200
Where black holes for air intakes and cooling define the era of combustion engines,

46
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:20,480
the face of the Polestar is characterised and defined by the SmartZone

47
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:27,560
where technology for safety sensors and pilot assistance is purposefully gathered.

48
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,480
Instead of tradition and preindustrial craftsmanship, we defined the new premium,

49
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,480
a premium that left the convention of  leather, wood and chrome behind.

50
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,600
This will be the aesthetics of the electric age, high-tech minimalism that redefines

51
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,400
luxury for the sustainable decade.

52
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,000
We have pressing questions that need answers.

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,439
Clearly sustainability is not limited to the electric drivetrain.

54
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:12,560
Sustainability means on a much broader sense, from the very first step of

55
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,040
the production of the car, to the very end when you actually take care of what

56
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,560
is left of the car in the recycling process, to come to a fully sustainable

57
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:26,399
chain of mobility.

58
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,319
It’s a new era that has started and the Polestar Precept is a messenger

59
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,319
of what is to come, and a reminder that our journey has just begun.
