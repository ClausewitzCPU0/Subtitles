Dialogue: 0,00:00:10.88,00:00:15.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,We brought the Polestar 1 into production and we launched the Polestar 2.

Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.80,00:00:21.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,Now for us inside Polestar we have a clear vision of where we are going.

Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.48,00:00:25.20,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,The answer is the Polestar Precept.

Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.36,00:00:42.76,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,Precept is an incarnation of the philosophy of our design, of our idea about how sustainability 

Dialogue: 0,00:00:42.76,00:00:49.56,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,can become a driving force, a driving  energy for our new cars. 

Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.56,00:00:53.68,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,That is what Precept is all about.

Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.00,00:01:03.28,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,A big focus, a strong focus is obviously an interior, that reduces the amount of

Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.48,00:01:06.32,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,plastic that you use.

Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.32,00:01:11.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,We work together with specialised partners and experts to cut the plastic content and

Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.60,00:01:17.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,lessen waste materials with innovative natural and recycled source materials, 

Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.00,00:01:19.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,in the interior of the Polestar Precept. 

Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.12,00:01:25.04,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,With the amazing powerRibs and ampliTex technologies from our partner Bcomp, 

Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.24,00:01:30.50,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,we turn natural fibers into lightweight and sustainable interior panels.

Dialogue: 0,00:01:30.88,00:01:36.72,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,This natural composite utilises flax and these new innovative interior panels then

Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.72,00:01:46.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,are up to 50% lighter and they reduce the plastic content by 80% compared to the traditional ones. 

Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.00,00:01:49.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,It’s really amazing, it’s lighter and at the same time stronger.

Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.32,00:02:11.56,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,It’s made exactly to size with no offcuts and that means we’ve completely removed

Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.56,00:02:14.40,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,the waste in its production process. 

Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.48,00:02:21.04,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,So, to show that car interior can be the nice atmosphere that you want it to be, 

Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.04,00:02:26.16,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,without the usual use of an excessive amount of virgin plastic, 

Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.16,00:02:31.64,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,I think that is one of the main focus areas of Precept.

Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.88,00:02:39.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,When we presented last year the Polestar 2 we were the first car brand coming out

Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.80,00:02:43.28,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,with a production car that has Android.

Dialogue: 0,00:02:43.28,00:02:48.84,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,Now that has incredible potential for the future, and some of it a gives

Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.84,00:02:51.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,a glimpse of how great the system will evolve over time.

Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.80,00:02:58.68,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,We take here in the Polestar Precept, example given, one that I actually like the most,

Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.68,00:03:02.84,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,is the proximity sensor that we built in there.

Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.04,00:03:09.44,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,You see an uncluttered, very easy to read aesthetically nice screen.

Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.68,00:03:14.08,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,But then when you reach out, buttons pop out, and more information comes.

Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.08,00:03:17.84,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,Big buttons that are easy to touch even when the car is moving. 

Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.84,00:03:26.28,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,So this animated proximity sensor is really a big big step into this hassle-free 

Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.28,00:03:28.76,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,future that we promise with our cars. 

Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.04,00:03:35.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,A big leap for safety in the car is the eye tracking system of the Precept. 

Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.44,00:03:40.24,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,One of the core benefits is monitoring the driver's health status.

Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.64,00:03:48.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,If not, the car takes appropriate actions such as warning or speed reduction. 

Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.20,00:03:53.56,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,On the driver-dedicated monitor in front of you, the information 

Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.56,00:03:59.92,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and signals of the pilot assist system are now combined with Google maps data. 

Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.32,00:04:07.44,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,So the turn-by-turn guidance is embedded into a fully contextualised navigation.

Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.24,00:04:14.20,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,Where black holes for air intakes and cooling define the era of combustion engines,

Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.48,00:04:27.56,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,where technology for safety sensors and pilot assistance is purposefully gathered.

Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.80,00:04:33.48,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,Instead of tradition and preindustrial craftsmanship, we defined the new premium,

Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.48,00:04:39.48,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,a premium that left the convention of  leather, wood and chrome behind.

Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.56,00:04:45.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,This will be the aesthetics of the electric age, high-tech minimalism that redefines

Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.12,00:04:59.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,We have pressing questions that need answers.

Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.00,00:05:05.44,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,Clearly sustainability is not limited to the electric drivetrain.

Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.44,00:05:12.56,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,Sustainability means on a much broader sense, from the very first step of

Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.56,00:05:17.04,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,the production of the car, to the very end when you actually take care of what

Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.04,00:05:22.56,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,is left of the car in the recycling process, to come to a fully sustainable

Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.56,00:05:32.32,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,It’s a new era that has started and the Polestar Precept is a messenger
