00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
大家好！这里是你们的好兄弟Carbot

2
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:03,420
我们刚上架这些新T恤

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,840
想购买的可以点击下方链接（简介里）

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,010
其中一件是Zerg Hi，另外一件是为了艾尔

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,680
如果你没看出来的话——这是T恤上在叉子周围的字

6
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:18,210
还有一件是三个Marine，裂盔哥和补丁哥和医疗兵。

7
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:19,791
等等，我的意思是两个枪兵和医疗兵

8
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:23,430
限时发售，心动不如行动

9
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:27,690
嘿，我是你们的好朋友John Burton，来自Carbot animations.

10
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:31,950
有观众让我多做一些动画教学

11
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:33,300
今天安排上了

12
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:39,990
首先，我们所有的动画都是用Adobe Animate CC

13
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:42,750
你可以在adobe.com上找到

14
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,250
这不是恰饭视频

15
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:47,460
因此这完全是用爱发电

16
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:49,980
对我来说这款软件毫无难度

17
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:52,440
今天要做的动画是跑步循环

18
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:54,480
我们将以叉子的跑步动作为例

19
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:57,150
当你在创作跑步循环动画

20
00:00:57,151 --> 00:01:00,390
尤其是在用An CC画跑步动作时

21
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:02,610
最重要的就是画出最夸张的姿势

22
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:08,190
比如一条胳膊尽可能靠前，一条腿尽可能向后。

23
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:10,140
画另外一对胳膊腿也是同样的道理

24
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:16,290
当你画完角色跑步的轮廓后

25
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,510
就可以进行下一步：把它变成一个元件(symbol)并且命名 (默认快捷键F8）

26
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:24,150
元件有自己的时间线并且会在整个主时间线上不断循环。

27
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:28,590
因此重用这个动作循环非常容易

28
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:30,690
如果角色需要跑过屏幕

29
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,403
你不需要重复每个步骤

30
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:35,940
只要你编辑好它的动画，就会一直循环它自己的动作

31
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:38,040
因此我所做的就是用很多图层

32
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,390
身体独立为一个图层

33
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,680
你画好身体之后

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,880
你可以创建一个新图层，再画一个从肩膀到身体上方的手臂

35
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,620
你就可以看到整个过程

36
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,680
完成手臂的绘画和上色工作后

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,760
我要把这个手臂也转换成元件

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,210
现在是元件套元件

39
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:55,710
工作有些进展了

40
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:57,720
双击这个元件

41
00:01:57,721 --> 00:01:59,760
事实上我们又一次将它变成了元件

42
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:04,770
原因是我们想给这两条手臂加上动画

43
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:08,940
如果你这么做，就会自动将其变为元件

44
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:11,760
我们想确保元件的锚点在肩膀上

45
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:13,590
锚点就是此处的小白点

46
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:17,070
这就是元件的旋转中心点

47
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,440
决定了元件如何旋转、变形

48
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:27,090
我们要给元件增加 移动补间(motion tween) ...(作者口误)

49
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:32,250
总的来说就是要让手臂在最前和最后两个位置之间来回摆动

50
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:38,340
完成这步之后，我们就可以返回身体部分做另一只手臂的工作

51
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:40,950
这个循环的时长大概是10帧

52
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:46,500
因此所有动画长度都要是10帧，比如手臂来回摆动也是10帧

53
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:47,700
复制这个手臂

54
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:51,150
把它放到另一层，放置在身体后面

55
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:53,250
因为我们的循环是10帧

56
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,220
偏移最大的是第6帧

57
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,180
因此反方向手臂的动作从第六帧开始

58
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:02,340
方法是点击属性页面

59
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:08,940
将first选项参数改为6

60
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:11,820
这意味着它将从第六帧开始运动而不是第一帧

61
00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:13,020
So I don't want to lose you guys here.

62
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:17,400
从第六帧开始的原因是：这个动作离第一帧最远

63
00:03:17,401 --> 00:03:19,590
而不是第十帧离第一帧最远

64
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:27,750
第十帧的下一帧就是第一帧，因为整个过程会循环 

65
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:32,400
第六帧是运动最远的一帧，它是动作过程的中点

66
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:37,440
这就是为什么你想让其中一只手臂从第六帧开始，而另一只从第一帧开始。

67
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:42,480
我会让两条手臂交错前后摆动

68
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,040
并循环这个过程

69
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,490
还要对两条腿做同样的操作

70
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:51,120
在前面这条腿和身体之间新建图层

71
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:54,660
画一条腿，转换为元件

72
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:57,968
这次，我们要让动画更加生动一些。

73
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,140
我们要做逐帧动画

74
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,910
这意味着我们要亲手画每一帧

75
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:09,090
这么做的原因是，膝盖和脚掌都会变形

76
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:12,900
因此为腿部做逐帧动画会更好

77
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:15,390
这样看上去就不会太僵硬，像真正在跑步一样。

78
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:17,640
If you do use a symbol which he can,

79
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:18,510
ah,

80
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:19,980
it'll just look a little bit more stiff,

81
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:21,480
which is fine when you're starting out,

82
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:25,740
so feel free to do the exact same thing that we do with the arms of the legs.

83
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:27,120
If you want to make it a little quick.

84
00:04:27,121 --> 00:04:30,360
But I'm going to animate each leg frame by frame to show you how it's done,

85
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:32,730
and we're going to start with the key frames of the leg again,

86
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:40,740
that is the most forward frame and the furthest back frame and the most extreme frames are going to land on one and six.

87
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,810
So we do those first,

88
00:04:42,811 --> 00:04:44,070
and then we do the in between,

89
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:46,500
which is every frame in between the key for,

90
00:04:46,501 --> 00:04:49,680
and that's basically joining them slowly moving the way cross.

91
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:50,250
As you see,

92
00:04:50,251 --> 00:04:54,060
a kind of the foot can have bends as it moves across the ground,

93
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,890
and the whole life changed a little bit of form.

94
00:04:55,891 --> 00:05:05,250
So once we call it that we're actually going to exit the symbol and then we're going to copy that leg and make a new layer in between the body and the arm that is behind the body at this point,

95
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:05,700
if you press,

96
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:06,930
play back and you,

97
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:12,180
you've tasted the leg and you know it's going to look like the zealot is hopping on two feet.

98
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:15,660
This is what happens when you have an alternate alternated,

99
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:20,880
the animation and start one of the legs on the six frame and not the first.

100
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:24,360
So we're going to keep one leg on the first frame and the other leg.

101
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:24,600
Ah,

102
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:26,820
we're going to start at the six frame again.

103
00:05:26,821 --> 00:05:28,080
Going to the properties tab,

104
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:31,680
you ought to make the right arm and the left leg in sync,

105
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:35,190
Meaning the right arms forward and the left leg is forward,

106
00:05:35,191 --> 00:05:36,330
and vice versa.

107
00:05:36,331 --> 00:05:36,990
With thee,

108
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:38,670
let the left arm,

109
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,140
and in the right leg,

110
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:41,850
they're going to be in sync with them,

111
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:48,090
being at the back that way and allow the xcel to run in a proper motion if you do the opposite,

112
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:50,610
if you have the right leg in the right arm forward,

113
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:51,930
it's going to look really,

114
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:53,070
really weird.

115
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:53,550
Ah,

116
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:56,910
and it obviously doesn't make any sense because it's like,

117
00:05:56,911 --> 00:05:57,420
yeah,

118
00:05:57,421 --> 00:06:03,930
it's like you're pulling your your legs with your arms and it looks not the way you wanted to look Basically,

119
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:08,130
so be sure to cycle the the limbs properly,

120
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:10,440
the opposing the right arm and left leg,

121
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:11,760
and vice versa,

122
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:16,080
starting on differ on the same frames and the other one's on frame.

123
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:21,300
Six If your run cycle is a phrase that it's going to be free from five,

124
00:06:21,301 --> 00:06:23,280
if it's twenty frames,

125
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:25,080
then it's going to be framed eleven and so on.

126
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:27,360
That's going to be the middle frame to give this runs,

127
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:28,680
let go a little bit more off.

128
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:33,450
I save the circle of the chest as its own layer,

129
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:33,960
And so we're gonna,

130
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:39,090
make that into a symbol and we're going to squash and stretch it as the torso moves.

131
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:41,580
Ah slightly from left to right,

132
00:06:41,581 --> 00:06:42,450
as is running,

133
00:06:42,451 --> 00:06:43,440
you don't have to do this.

134
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:45,660
you could just draw the the circle in.

135
00:06:45,661 --> 00:06:45,960
Ah,

136
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:51,330
I'm doing this as an additional option of how you can spice up the run.

137
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:52,830
So if you exit the symbol,

138
00:06:52,831 --> 00:06:55,260
you can now see the run cycle looks pretty good,

139
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:55,590
You know,

140
00:06:55,591 --> 00:06:57,510
it doesn't look too bad.

141
00:06:57,511 --> 00:06:57,960
Ah,

142
00:06:57,961 --> 00:07:03,480
and we can actually spices up a little more by turning the whole run cycle into another symbol,

143
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:04,830
and he'd call out whatever he wants.

144
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:08,190
The reason why we're going to do this is because right now he's running,

145
00:07:08,191 --> 00:07:09,210
and he just is.

146
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:10,680
He's not bouncing whatsoever.

147
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,260
He's kind of almost like he's gliding along the ground.

148
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:15,600
It looks fine for a simple animation,

149
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,960
but if you do want to make it a little bit nicer,

150
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:20,310
you can do this as well.

151
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:24,270
So once you made the whole run cycle into an additional symbol,

152
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:27,660
we're in a right click and make it into a motion tween,

153
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:29,550
and we're going to make the zealot bounce up,

154
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:30,360
And down,

155
00:07:30,361 --> 00:07:31,500
so in this timeline,

156
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:37,110
you want him to bounce up and down twice because there's two legs there that are alternating between the two,

157
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:39,990
so we're going to make the first frame and the last frame.

158
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:42,930
the exact same keefe ranges press at six.

159
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:44,310
I don't move yet.

160
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:45,780
then the middle frame again,

161
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:47,340
this is framed six.

162
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:47,610
Ah,

163
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:51,360
we are going to make that the exact same position as well,

164
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:53,880
so we could have six on the middle frame as well.

165
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:57,870
the frames in between these three dots.

166
00:07:57,871 --> 00:07:58,140
Ah,

167
00:07:58,141 --> 00:07:59,340
we can actually like.

168
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:02,190
I think it shows the frame three in frame.

169
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:05,790
seven We can drag the symbol down of bits.

170
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:06,570
Ah,

171
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:08,760
on both of those sprained three in frame.

172
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:09,510
seven.

173
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:10,770
If you play it back,

174
00:08:10,771 --> 00:08:11,760
you can now see,

175
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:14,790
the zealot is bouncing a bit and even made a bounce forward,

176
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,530
not just up in a little bit forward,

177
00:08:16,531 --> 00:08:17,220
not too much.

178
00:08:17,221 --> 00:08:20,370
You don't want to do too much better than bouncing up as well.

179
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:21,270
Especially so,

180
00:08:21,271 --> 00:08:22,680
if he acts of that symbol now,

181
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:26,730
now we have the salt bouncing up and down while he's running again,

182
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:28,080
some most of the time.

183
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:28,410
actually,

184
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:31,560
Almost every time I set it for good animation,

185
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:34,230
you just want to isolate each section,

186
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:36,570
so you're not trying to do everything all at once.

187
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:40,560
You can always adjust and add to the animation later on.

188
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,180
Make sure you do the proper planning,

189
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:43,170
so that's it guys.

190
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:45,420
That's how you do a pretty decent,

191
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:46,500
easy run cycle,

192
00:08:46,501 --> 00:08:48,480
so run cycles are a little bit difficult,

193
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:50,550
especially when you're first starting animation.

194
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:53,340
It's because the limbs are kind of gone everywhere,

195
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:55,230
there need to be the opposite.

196
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:57,330
and I've seen plenty of people like they.

197
00:08:57,331 --> 00:08:58,320
Kind of get confused,

198
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:02,550
of which live is where you can actually darken as I did in this animation,

199
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:07,500
the limbs that are on the behind the body.

200
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:07,890
Ah,

201
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:11,250
you could do that by selecting the symbols that are the lives behind the body,

202
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:16,770
the leg in the arm and going down to two to color,

203
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:22,800
and then clicking the dropdown and going to brightness and and adjusting the brightness to make it a little darker.

204
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:24,870
This will help you follow what the heck is going on,

205
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:26,910
or you can kind of just side here.

206
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:28,530
You change of his ability.

207
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:29,670
One more thing before we go,

208
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:31,020
we can do a bit of a macro.

209
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:34,200
Here is what we do with crowd shots.

210
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:42,150
if we want a lots of characters running it on screen and we don't want to continuously do new motion tweens to make a run across,

211
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:46,680
we can actually again make the zealots another symbol.

212
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:47,010
Ah,

213
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:49,260
his bouncing up and down run cycle,

214
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:52,680
and we can create that into a three second.

215
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:53,010
However,

216
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:57,960
many second now run run run across a screen animation,

217
00:09:57,961 --> 00:09:59,010
which is super easy.

218
00:09:59,011 --> 00:09:59,790
We just need to right,

219
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:04,590
click and make a motion tween and then go to the furthest frame and drag them across the screen.

220
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:05,070
So now,

221
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:08,970
when you exit out of the air out of that symbol again,

222
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:13,260
we're like inception ising here like crazy when she accepted that symbol,

223
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:16,320
you can now copy and paste that symbol shrink and grow,

224
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:18,240
put it behind in other frames,

225
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:21,870
and you have a beautiful crowd shot with proper perspective,

226
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,090
all adults are running the same speed,

227
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:29,340
but now their summer front summer behind and saves you a lot of time again.

228
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:35,430
I getting to know the programs that your animation and using it to your advantage can save you tons of time.

229
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:40,950
I did not do this at first when I first started animating in doing Youtube videos.

230
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:42,030
The more I do it,

231
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:46,380
the more time I save in the more I'm kicking myself that I should have done it before.

232
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:47,760
so that's it guys that thinks,

233
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:51,030
watch and hope you enjoyed the video hope mates heads.

234
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:51,360
Ah,

235
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:53,280
it is very technical.

236
00:10:53,281 --> 00:11:02,550
are spending some time and wrapping your head around the technicalities of the program again will really help you understand it and make the program work for you.

237
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:04,740
So that is a basic run cycle.

238
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:05,220
Again,

239
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:07,230
you don't have to do the bouncing up and down thing.

240
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:09,000
He could have stopped halfway through this.

241
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,940
But those those two extra things are kind of icing on the cake,

242
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:15,600
making a little bit better and a little bit more effective in your animation,

243
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:17,700
so guys like videos described,

244
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:18,990
you'll like its stuff.

245
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:20,250
hope you enjoy it.

246
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:22,950
I'll let me know what you would like to see animation tutorials,

247
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:25,710
the future on for those who are interested.

248
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:27,720
I OK,

249
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,730
I best friend talk to you later.

250
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,290
We'll hang out this weekend.

251
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,010
Okay, bye-bye.
