00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
大家好！这里是你们的好兄弟Carbot

2
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:03,420
我们刚上架这些新T恤

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,840
想购买的可以点击下方链接（简介里）
https://www.teepublic.com/stores/carbotanimation


4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,010
其中一件是Zerg Hi，另外一件是为了艾尔

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,680
如果你没看出来的话——这是T恤上在叉子周围的字

6
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:18,210
还有一件是三个Marine，裂盔哥和补丁哥和医疗兵。

7
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:19,791
等等，我的意思是两个枪兵和医疗兵

8
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:23,430
限时发售，心动不如行动

9
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:27,690
嘿，我是你们的好朋友John Burton，来自Carbot animations.

10
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:31,950
有观众让我多做一些动画教学

11
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:33,300
今天安排上了

12
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:39,990
首先，我们所有的动画都是用Adobe Animate CC

13
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:42,750
你可以在adobe.com上找到

14
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,250
这不是恰饭视频

15
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:47,460
因此这完全是用爱发电

16
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:49,980
对我来说这款软件毫无难度

17
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:52,440
今天要做的动画是跑步循环

18
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:54,480
我们将以叉子的跑步动作为例

19
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:57,150
当你在创作跑步循环动画

20
00:00:57,151 --> 00:01:00,390
尤其是在用An CC画跑步动作时

21
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:02,610
最重要的就是画出最夸张的姿势

22
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:08,190
比如一条胳膊尽可能靠前，一条腿尽可能向后。

23
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:10,140
画另外一对胳膊腿也是同样的道理

24
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:16,290
当你画完角色跑步的轮廓后

25
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,510
就可以进行下一步：把它变成一个元件(symbol)并且命名 (默认快捷键F8）

26
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:24,150
元件有自己的时间线并且会在整个主时间线上不断循环。

27
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:28,590
因此重用这个动作循环非常容易

28
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:30,690
如果角色需要跑过屏幕

29
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,403
你不需要重复每个步骤

30
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:35,940
只要你编辑好它的动画，就会一直循环它自己的动作

31
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:38,040
因此我所做的就是用很多图层

32
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,390
身体独立为一个图层

33
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,680
你画好身体之后

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,880
你可以创建一个新图层，再画一个从肩膀到身体上方的手臂

35
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,620
你就可以看到整个过程

36
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,680
完成手臂的绘画和上色工作后

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,760
我要把这个手臂也转换成元件

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,210
现在是元件套元件

39
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:55,710
工作有些进展了

40
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:57,720
双击这个元件

41
00:01:57,721 --> 00:01:59,760
事实上我们又一次将它变成了元件

42
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:04,770
原因是我们想给这两条手臂加上动画

43
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:08,940
如果你这么做，就会自动将其变为元件

44
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:11,760
我们想确保元件的锚点在肩膀上

45
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:13,590
锚点就是此处的小白点

46
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:17,070
这就是元件的旋转中心点

47
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,440
决定了元件如何旋转、变形

48
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:27,090
我们要给元件增加 移动补间(motion tween) ...(作者口误)

49
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:32,250
总的来说就是要让手臂在最前和最后两个位置之间来回摆动

50
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:38,340
完成这步之后，我们就可以返回身体部分做另一只手臂的工作

51
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:40,950
这个循环的时长大概是10帧

52
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:46,500
因此所有动画长度都要是10帧，比如手臂来回摆动也是10帧

53
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:47,700
复制这个手臂

54
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:51,150
把它放到另一层，放置在身体后面

55
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:53,250
因为我们的循环是10帧

56
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,220
偏移最大的是第6帧

57
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,180
因此反方向手臂的动作从第六帧开始

58
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:02,340
方法是点击属性页面

59
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:08,940
将first选项参数改为6

60
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:11,820
这意味着它将从第六帧开始运动而不是第一帧

61
00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:13,020
So I don't want to lose you guys here.

62
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:17,400
从第六帧开始的原因是：这个动作离第一帧最远

63
00:03:17,401 --> 00:03:19,590
而不是第十帧离第一帧最远

64
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:27,750
第十帧的下一帧就是第一帧，因为整个过程会循环 

65
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:32,400
第六帧是运动最远的一帧，它是动作过程的中点

66
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:37,440
这就是为什么你想让其中一只手臂从第六帧开始，而另一只从第一帧开始。

67
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:42,480
我会让两条手臂交错前后摆动

68
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,040
并循环这个过程

69
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,490
还要对两条腿做同样的操作

70
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:51,120
在前面这条腿和身体之间新建图层

71
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:54,660
画一条腿，转换为元件

72
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:57,968
这次，我们要让动画更加生动一些。

73
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,140
我们要做逐帧动画

74
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,910
这意味着我们要亲手画每一帧

75
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:09,090
这么做的原因是，跑步时膝盖和脚掌都会变形

76
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:12,900
因此为腿部做逐帧动画会更好

77
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:15,390
这样看上去就不会太僵硬，像真正在跑步一样。

78
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:19,980
如果你还是用元件和补间来做，你会发现动作看上去有点僵硬

79
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:21,480
对于初学者，完全可以这么做

80
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:27,120
想节约时间的话，你完全可以使用同样的办法来做动画 

81
00:04:27,121 --> 00:04:30,360
我将会逐帧作画让你观察整个过程

82
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:32,730
还是从腿部关键帧开始

83
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:40,740
这是腿部运动的最前一帧和最后一帧，运动的极限位置在第六帧

84
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,500
因此我们先画这些关键帧，然后再画中间帧 

85
00:04:46,501 --> 00:04:49,680
基本上就是将运动过程慢慢画出来

86
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:54,060
你可以看到，当脚接触地面时会弯曲

87
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,890
整个腿部的形状也改变了一些

88
00:04:55,891 --> 00:05:04,567
上色时需要退出元件，再复制腿部到位于手臂和身体中间的一个新的层

89
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:06,930
这时你点击播放，

90
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:12,180
你就会看到一个双脚同时跳跃的叉子

91
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:20,880
当你没有把其中一条腿设置为从第六帧开始播放，就会出现这种情况。

92
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:26,820
因此我们要将一条腿设置为从第一帧开始运动，另一条腿从第六帧开始

93
00:05:26,821 --> 00:05:28,080
再回到属性页面

94
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:31,680
要将左手和右脚同步

95
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:35,190
左手向前摆动时，右脚也向前摆动

96
00:05:35,191 --> 00:05:36,330
反之亦然

97
00:05:36,331 --> 00:05:42,560
这样它们就同步了

98
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,700
这种方式可以让叉子有正确的跑步动作

99
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,090
如果你反向操作

100
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:50,610
假设你顺拐了

101
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:53,070
那看起来就很奇怪了

102
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:57,420
这毫无道理

103
00:05:57,421 --> 00:06:03,930
就像你的手拉着你的脚在跑，这肯定不是你想要的效果。

104
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:08,130
确保四肢有正确的动作循环

105
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:11,760
手脚动作相反

106
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:16,080
其中一对同时开始，另一对从第六帧开始。

107
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:21,300
如果你的循环有8帧，那么另一对从第五帧开始

108
00:06:21,301 --> 00:06:25,080
如果循环有20帧，那么另一对从11帧开始，以此类推

109
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:26,585
差不多是中间帧的样子

110
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:28,680
为了给跑步动作增加更多细节

111
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:33,450
我为胸前的蓝圈设置了单独的一层

112
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:39,090
把它转换为元件，让他随着身体运动展现出拉伸和变形效果

113
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:42,450
在跑步时轻微地从左到右摆动

114
00:06:42,451 --> 00:06:45,660
你可以跳过这一步，画个圈就行

115
00:06:45,661 --> 00:06:51,330
这作为选做内容，可以让跑步动画更生动

116
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:52,830
如果你退出元件模式

117
00:06:52,831 --> 00:06:57,510
你可以看到很不错的效果 

118
00:06:57,511 --> 00:07:03,480
通过将整个模块转换成另一个元件，我们还能让动作看起来更有趣一些

119
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:04,830
你可以随便起个名

120
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:08,190
这么做的原因是，虽然叉子已经在跑了

121
00:07:08,191 --> 00:07:10,680
但是它没有弹跳的动作

122
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,260
而是有点像在地面在滑行

123
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:15,600
对简单的动画来说这不是什么问题

124
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:20,310
但如果你想更进一步,也是可行的

125
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:24,270
将整个模块转换成额外的元件

126
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:27,660
右键，并增加动作补间

127
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:30,360
为叉子增加弹跳的感觉

128
00:07:30,361 --> 00:07:31,500
在这个时间线里

129
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:37,110
我们想让他弹跳两次，因为它是两腿交替运动的

130
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:39,990
因此我们要做好第一帧和最后一帧

131
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:42,930
还有第六帧的关键帧

132
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:44,310
I don't move yet.

133
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:45,780
then the middle frame again,

134
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:47,340
this is framed six.

135
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:47,610
Ah,

136
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:51,360
we are going to make that the exact same position as well,

137
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:53,880
so we could have six on the middle frame as well.

138
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:57,870
the frames in between these three dots.

139
00:07:57,871 --> 00:07:58,140
Ah,

140
00:07:58,141 --> 00:07:59,340
we can actually like.

141
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:02,190
I think it shows the frame three in frame.

142
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:05,790
seven We can drag the symbol down of bits.

143
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:06,570
Ah,

144
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:08,760
on both of those sprained three in frame.

145
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:09,510
seven.

146
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:10,770
If you play it back,

147
00:08:10,771 --> 00:08:11,760
you can now see,

148
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:14,790
the zealot is bouncing a bit and even made a bounce forward,

149
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,530
not just up in a little bit forward,

150
00:08:16,531 --> 00:08:17,220
not too much.

151
00:08:17,221 --> 00:08:20,370
You don't want to do too much better than bouncing up as well.

152
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:21,270
Especially so,

153
00:08:21,271 --> 00:08:22,680
if he acts of that symbol now,

154
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:26,730
now we have the salt bouncing up and down while he's running again,

155
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:28,080
some most of the time.

156
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:28,410
actually,

157
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:31,560
Almost every time I set it for good animation,

158
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:34,230
you just want to isolate each section,

159
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:36,570
so you're not trying to do everything all at once.

160
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:40,560
You can always adjust and add to the animation later on.

161
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,180
Make sure you do the proper planning,

162
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:43,170
so that's it guys.

163
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:45,420
That's how you do a pretty decent,

164
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:46,500
easy run cycle,

165
00:08:46,501 --> 00:08:48,480
so run cycles are a little bit difficult,

166
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:50,550
especially when you're first starting animation.

167
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:53,340
It's because the limbs are kind of gone everywhere,

168
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:55,230
there need to be the opposite.

169
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:57,330
and I've seen plenty of people like they.

170
00:08:57,331 --> 00:08:58,320
Kind of get confused,

171
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:02,550
of which live is where you can actually darken as I did in this animation,

172
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:07,500
the limbs that are on the behind the body.

173
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:07,890
Ah,

174
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:11,250
you could do that by selecting the symbols that are the lives behind the body,

175
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:16,770
the leg in the arm and going down to two to color,

176
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:22,800
and then clicking the dropdown and going to brightness and and adjusting the brightness to make it a little darker.

177
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:24,870
This will help you follow what the heck is going on,

178
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:26,910
or you can kind of just side here.

179
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:28,530
You change of his ability.

180
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:29,670
One more thing before we go,

181
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:31,020
we can do a bit of a macro.

182
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:34,200
Here is what we do with crowd shots.

183
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:42,150
if we want a lots of characters running it on screen and we don't want to continuously do new motion tweens to make a run across,

184
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:46,680
we can actually again make the zealots another symbol.

185
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:47,010
Ah,

186
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:49,260
his bouncing up and down run cycle,

187
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:52,680
and we can create that into a three second.

188
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:53,010
However,

189
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:57,960
many second now run run run across a screen animation,

190
00:09:57,961 --> 00:09:59,010
which is super easy.

191
00:09:59,011 --> 00:09:59,790
We just need to right,

192
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:04,590
click and make a motion tween and then go to the furthest frame and drag them across the screen.

193
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:05,070
So now,

194
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:08,970
when you exit out of the air out of that symbol again,

195
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:13,260
we're like inception ising here like crazy when she accepted that symbol,

196
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:16,320
you can now copy and paste that symbol shrink and grow,

197
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:18,240
put it behind in other frames,

198
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:21,870
and you have a beautiful crowd shot with proper perspective,

199
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,090
all adults are running the same speed,

200
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:29,340
but now their summer front summer behind and saves you a lot of time again.

201
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:35,430
I getting to know the programs that your animation and using it to your advantage can save you tons of time.

202
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:40,950
I did not do this at first when I first started animating in doing Youtube videos.

203
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:42,030
The more I do it,

204
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:46,380
the more time I save in the more I'm kicking myself that I should have done it before.

205
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:47,760
so that's it guys that thinks,

206
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:51,030
watch and hope you enjoyed the video hope mates heads.

207
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:51,360
Ah,

208
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:53,280
it is very technical.

209
00:10:53,281 --> 00:11:02,550
are spending some time and wrapping your head around the technicalities of the program again will really help you understand it and make the program work for you.

210
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:04,740
So that is a basic run cycle.

211
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:05,220
Again,

212
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:07,230
you don't have to do the bouncing up and down thing.

213
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:09,000
He could have stopped halfway through this.

214
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,940
But those those two extra things are kind of icing on the cake,

215
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:15,600
making a little bit better and a little bit more effective in your animation,

216
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:17,700
so guys like videos described,

217
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:18,990
you'll like its stuff.

218
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:20,250
hope you enjoy it.

219
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:22,950
I'll let me know what you would like to see animation tutorials,

220
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:25,710
the future on for those who are interested.

221
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:27,720
I OK,

222
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,730
I best friend talk to you later.

223
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,290
We'll hang out this weekend.

224
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,010
Okay, bye-bye.
