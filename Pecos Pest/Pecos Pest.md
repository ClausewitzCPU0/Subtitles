### 小青蛙求爱

一首传统民谣

### Froggie Went A-Courting - Woody Guthrie

```
Frog went a-courtin' and a-he did a-ride. Hey, hey.
((Frogie went a-courtin' and a-he did ride, Hey, hey.))
((Frogie went a-courtin' and a-he did ride,))
Sword and a pistol by his side.
((Hey, hey-hey, hey.))

Rode till he come to Miss Mouse's door. ((Hey, hey.))
Rode till he come to Miss Mouse's door. ((Hey, hey.))
((Rode till he come to Miss Mouse's door,))
Gave three raps and a barrel outroar 6 .
((Hey, hey-hey, hey.))

Said, "Miss Mouse, are you within? ((Hey, hey.))
Said, "Miss Mouse, are you within? ((Hey, hey.))
Said, "Miss Mouse, are you within?"
"Yes, I just sat down to spin."
((Hey, hey-hey, hey.))

Well, he went a-right in an' took'er on his knee. Hey, hey.
((Went a-right in an' took'er on his knee. Hey, hey.))
Went a-right in an' took'er on his knee,
I'm set in this town, till yer marryin' me.
((Hey, hey-hey, hey.))

Miss Mouse said, "I cain't answer that." ((Hey, hey.))
((Miss Mousie said, "I cain't answer that." Hey, hey.))
Miss Mouse said, "I cain't answer that,
Till I seen my brother, Rat.
((Hey, hey-hey, hey.))

When a-brother, Rat, gave his consent... ((Hey, hey.))
((When brother, Rat, gave his consent... Hey, hey.))
When brother, Rat, gave his consent,
The weasel wrote the public 'vent.
((Hey, hey-hey, hey.))

Who will the wedding guests all be? ((Hey, hey.))
((Who will the wedding guests all be? Hey, hey.))
Who will the wedding guests all be?
A lady bug and a bumble bee.
((Hey, hey-hey, hey.)) (Woo!)

Hey, hey-hey, hey.

Well, the first to come was a little lady bug. ((Hey, hey.))
((First to come was a little lady bug. Hey, hey.))
First guest to come was a little lady bug,
She had a great big whiskey jug.
((Hey, hey-hey, hey.))

Well, the next to come was a bumble bee. ((Hey, hey.))
((Next to come was a bumble bee. Hey, hey.))
Next to come was a bumble bee,
Dancin' a jig with a two-legged flea.
((Hey, hey-hey, hey.))

First one to come was a little, bitty moth. ((Hey, hey.)) 7
((First one to come was a little, bitty moth. ((Hey, hey.))
First one to come was a little, bitty moth,
First one to lay the table cloth.
((Hey, hey-hey, hey.))

So, here’s the endin', a-one, two, three. ((Hey, hey.))
((Here’s the endin', a-one, two, three. Hey, hey.))
Here's the end with a-one, two, three,
A snake and a frog and a-Miss Mousie.
Hey, hey-hey, hey.

Also in the cartoon [Tom and Jerry](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Tom%20and%20Jerry), uncle Pecos sings a song about a cram bone! Nobody really knows where the hell this word came from, but if you ever met someone that said something soo stupid, you would say what a cram bone!
